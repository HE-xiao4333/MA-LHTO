%-1000 represents an environment with 1000 devices, where the device positions are random.

The main file is OnlineGPU_main.py, which can be executed directly using Python

config.py stores some fixed parameters, such as the number of devices, locations, and the number of tasks. Before executing the algorithm, you need to check whether the execution address is correct.

Some execution result csv files and origin files are stored in the Others folder. You can see the experimental results in work.

Among them, some files (algorithms) are missing now. They will be uploaded after the article is accepted and published. 
However, the system model (OnlineGPU_main.py, OnlineGPU_MES.py) has been uploaded and can be modified based on this.
